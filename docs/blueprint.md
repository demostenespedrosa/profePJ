## Core Features:

- Cadastro Conversacional: Simulate a chat to collect user information, such as school details, hourly rate, and MEI due date, to ease the onboarding process.
- Lote de Aulas: The app must have the option of easily importing lots of classes. It has to be fast and the schedule will block the periods when there's 'Recesso'.
- Conclusão Dopaminérgica: Provide immediate, visually appealing feedback upon lesson completion, including a ka-ching sound, animated money, and split allocation details for different 'pots'.
- Gestão de Recessos: Allow users to manage school recesses and proactively notify them about upcoming breaks and the availability of funds in their 'pots'.
- Derrota do Chefão DAS: Gamify the process of paying the DAS tax with a 'monster' metaphor, confetti animation upon completion, and congratulatory feedback.
- Alocação Automágica: Automatically allocate a percentage of earnings into virtual 'pots' for expenses like 13th salary and vacations. Requires integration with Firestore to automatically write.
- Feedback da IA: Utilize the Gemini AI model as a tool to generate friendly, encouraging pop-up messages and action cards throughout the app, creating a personal 'cheerleader' experience.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A076F9) to represent organization, reliability and user empathy.
- Background color: Light purple (#ECE8FF) to give a professional but engaging experience
- Accent color: Saturated blue (#76A0F9) for highlights, CTAs and alerts.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality. For the body, consider 16px. Since all the app information has low importance, readability is key
- Use expressive and dynamic icons that fit a friendly mascot. It must give positive feedback, and try to simulate haptic feedback when the real haptic feedback can't be achieved
- The user interface should look similar to an iOS app (mimicking the look of an native application).
- Use various UI animations and transition to give feedback, but with a high attention to not generate stress or visual pollution
